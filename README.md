Introduction
In this project, we analyze the relationships between the daily returns of stocks listed in the provided dataset. The main objectives are:

Data Preparation: Cleaning and preprocessing the data.
Correlation Matrix Computation: Calculating the correlation matrix for the stock returns.
Data Visualization: Creating heatmaps to visualize the correlations.
Analysis: Identifying highly correlated stock pairs.
Installation
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install the required packages using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
Usage

cd stock-returns-correlation
Place your stock data file in the repository directory.

Run the analysis script:

bash
Copy code
python analyze_stock_correlations.py
This script will:

Load and preprocess the stock data.
Calculate the daily returns and compute the correlation matrix.
Visualize the correlation matrix using a heatmap.
Results
The main output of this analysis is a heatmap showing the correlation matrix of stock returns. This visualization helps in identifying highly correlated stock pairs, which is useful for portfolio management and investment decision-making.
